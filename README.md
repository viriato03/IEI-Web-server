## ℹ️ What is a README.md?

A `README.md` file is the front page of your project. It's the first file visitors see and its primary goal is to **introduce your project** and explain **how to use it**.

It's written in **Markdown** (that's what the `.md` extension means), a simple language for formatting plain text. A good README is essential for helping people understand your work, use it correctly, and contribute to it.
